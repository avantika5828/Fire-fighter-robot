# 🔥 Fire Fighter Robot

## 🤖 Project Overview

The **Fire Fighter Robot** is an autonomous robotic system developed to detect and extinguish fires in hazardous environments. Equipped with flame and temperature sensors, the robot automatically navigates toward a fire source and activates its extinguishing system to suppress it. The primary aim of this project is to reduce the risks faced by human firefighters by enabling robotic intervention in unsafe or unreachable zones.

## 🛠️ Features

- 🔍 Fire detection using flame and temperature sensors
- 🚗 Autonomous navigation with obstacle avoidance
- 💧 Built-in fire extinguishing system (water or foam-based)
- 📶 Remote monitoring via wireless communication (optional)
- ⚙️ Expandable for AI, IoT, and real-time updates

## 📌 Use Cases

- Industrial safety in factories, warehouses, and chemical plants
- Emergency response in fire-prone zones
- Educational demonstration of robotics and automation
- Smart building and campus safety systems

## 🧰 Technologies Used

- Arduino / Raspberry Pi (microcontroller)
- Flame sensor
- Temperature sensor (e.g., DHT11, LM35)
- Motor driver and DC motors
- Water pump and tank
- Wireless modules (optional: Bluetooth/Wi-Fi)
- Chassis and wheels
- Power supply/battery

## 🧠 How It Works

1. The sensors continuously scan for heat and flame signatures.
2. Upon detection, the robot calculates the direction and distance.
3. It navigates autonomously towards the fire source.
4. Once near, it activates the extinguisher to douse the fire.
5. The system can be monitored or overridden remotely if needed.
